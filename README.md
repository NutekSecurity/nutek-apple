# nutek-apple üçé

Nutek Security Platform for macOS and Linux operating systems. Tools for hackers, bug hunters and hobbiests. You might like it, you might not. It's a matter of taste.

## What it do?

This - part of `Nutek Security Platform` - program for _macOS_ and _Linux_ operating systems installs all the neccessairly _tools_ for well prepared 
_hacker_, _bug hunter_ or
a seasoned _hobbiest_ willing to pursue a way of turning things inside out and
is not scared to use only command line tools with . Why? Almost all of the fancy
GUI apps started as a command line tool, or are
in many ways similar, or even less capable, because in command line - you're
on the top, you're left alone like _Alice in Wonderland_ deep inside your dreams of power, and you know what? You can have this power! Just follow along.

If you look for some other help in hacking, pentesting or else, there are
links to other parts of Internet, that when you instal Firefox, or have
been using Safari, will open in browser window...


The only exceptions for the CLI rule are text editors (NeoVim in CLI), terminals and Wireshark (try termshark in CLI).

## Installation

### Homebrew

1. Install Homebrew (dependency for most mmacOS packages and some Linux too)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

or look it up on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)

2. Install Go programming language

You may use your Homebrew

```bash
brew install go
```

or directly from upstream on the official Go language webpage

[https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)

### nutek-apple installation using go or latest binaries

Use Go or download [latest builds](https://github.com/nuteksecurity/nutek-apple/releases/)

```bash

## TODO

* change README.md to reflect change to Go programming languagae
* ‚ö†Ô∏è add useful links with open by firefox option
* ‚ö†Ô∏è export git auto-update to Ruby gem
* ‚ö†Ô∏è add install and uninstall for one program
* ‚ö†Ô∏è make user able to read Homebrew information about a particular program; thin wrapper-like around Homebrew - not to deep, just basic install, uninstall and info, also very important, __update__
* ‚ö†Ô∏è keep user in my app, so no info is leaked to Homebrew and back.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è add programming languages (rust, ruby - (how? maybe with an installation script?), python, dotnet (C#?, powershell?), go...) to list of available programs
* ‚ö†Ô∏è add nutek-cipher and nutek-smoke
* ‚ö†Ô∏è make a proposal for katarina to gather around Zed text editor and collaborate
* ‚ö†Ô∏è write about each program in my book - _Hacking with a DREAM in the mind_
* ‚ö†Ô∏è add test that check if software is installed, and other cli commands
