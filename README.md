# nutek-apple üçé

Lists, lists, lists...

## What it do?

It shows and hosts various lists, groups, bookmarks, programs and other information about the world of _Hacking_

## Installation

### Homebrew

1. Install Homebrew (dependency for most mmacOS programs (and some Linux too)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

or look it up on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)

2. Install Go programming language

You may use your Homebrew

```bash
brew install go
```

or directly from upstream on the official Go language webpage

[https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)

### nutek-apple installation

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NutekSecurity/nutek-apple/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## If you are stuck, and can't run the script

call the git pull command:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

This will let you incorporate any changes you've made. You might need to commit first.

## What you will get?

Dividing & conquering my vision of _nutek apple_ I think, it would be nice if you
could add some of your lists... Let's start first with Homebrew. It's not complicated -
check if it exist, add instructions to install, description and possibly a manual page,
or your blog post about it, and I think we should be good. Everything is already laid out.
