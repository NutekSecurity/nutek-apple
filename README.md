# nutek-apple üçé

Nutek Security Platform for macOS and Linux operating systems. Tools for hackers, bug hunters and hobbiests. You might like it, you might not. It's a matter of taste.

## What it does?

This - `nutek-apple.rb` - script for macOS and Linux operating systems installs
all the neccessairly tools for well prepared hacker, bug hunter or
a seasoned hobbiest willing to pursue a way of turning things inside out and
is not scared to use only command line tools with . Why? Almost all of the fancy
GUI (don't there are some of them) apps started as a command line tool, or are
in many ways similar, or even less capable, because in command line - you're
on top, you're left alone like Alice in Wonderland deep inside your dreams of power, and you know what? You can have this power! Just follow along.


The only exceptions for this are text editors, terminals and Wireshark (try termshark in CLI).

## Installation

1. Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NutekSecurity/nutek-apple.git
```

to some safe location on your Apple/PC computer. Make sure you have Ruby installed, and also Homebrew (that's from where we'll be fetching apps) - you can get Homebrew from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

3. You should already have Ruby installed on your computer, but if you don't, you can install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ruby
```

on Linux, you can install Ruby with your package manager, for example on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install ruby
```
on Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install ruby
```

4. You're on start line. Run this command:

```shell
bundle install --without development,test
```

```shell
ruby nutek-apple.rb
```

or make this happen:

```shell
chmod 744 nutek-apple.rb
./nutek-apple.rb
```

This should present you with help message, and there you will find everything you need, but in case of clarity, I provide the transcript.
